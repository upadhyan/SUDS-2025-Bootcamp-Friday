    "## Expectation Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectation Maximization (EM) is a powerful algorithm that comes up a lot in different avenues of data science. K-Means is a good example of this algorithm, and we'll go through it briefly here. In short, K-Means consists of the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guess some cluster centres (at random, or using a heuristic)\n",
    "* Repeat until convergence (i.e. the clusters stop changing between steps):\n",
    "    * _E-Step_: Assign each point to the closest cluster centre\n",
    "    * _M-Step_: Set the cluster centres to the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the \"E-step\" or \"Expectation step\" is so-named because it involves updating our expectation of which cluster each point belongs to. The \"M-step\" or \"Maximization step\" is so-named because it involves maximizing some fitness function that defines the location of the cluster centers—in this case, that maximization is accomplished by taking a simple mean of the data in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature about this algorithm is vast, but can be summarized as follows: under typical circumstances, each repetition of the E-step and M-step will always result in a better estimate of the cluster characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Means algorithm is simple enough that we can write it in a few lines of code. The following is a very basic implementation:"

For example, the random seed used to initialize the clusters can affect the results - there is no guarantee that the algorithm will find the best _possible_ solution. (For an example of this, try changing the random seed in the previous example to `3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem with K-Means is that you must tell it how many clusters to look for - it cannot learn this from the data. This is fine in simple, low-dimensional examples such as the one above, but when the data is high-dimensional it becomes impossible to eyeball the correct number of clusters for your data. In fact, we can pass any number of clusters to the algorithm and it won't complain:"

    "Woah! Using t-SNE, the clusters are much more clearly defined, with different numbers being clearly separated in the low dimensional space. Running a clustering algorithm like K-Means now would likely give us pretty reasonable performance on classifying the digits, even just from two dimensions.\n",
